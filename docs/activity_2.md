# Activity 2 - The Cheshire Cat

## Type Restrictions in Classes

The Cheshire Cat is famous for disappearing but leaving only a wide grin visible in the air.

Unfortunately, it seems that he's currently displaying the wrong facial expression and he won't let you continue.

👉 Check out `2_cheshire_cat.ts` and note the FIXME: you have to add some code without altering anything else.

Again, the puzzle is very simple. The expression is defined to be one of a small number of possibilities.

👉 Try setting the cat's expression to something random: `theCat.expression = "Jealous";` for example.

Notice how TypeScript gives you some helpers via autocomplete, and it won't let you set it to just anything?

👉 Replace the FIXME and set the cat's expression to a grin as required to move on:

```JavaScript
theCat.expression = '😁 Grin 😁';
```

That was easy! Make sure you understand the `class` syntax and how we've restricted the possible expressions before moving on.

Now let's go meet the Mad Hatter in [activity 3](./activity_3.md).
